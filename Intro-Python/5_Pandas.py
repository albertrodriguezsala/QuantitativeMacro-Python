I found that python was extremely useful in cleaning and analysing data. I found it better than stata and R.
 I don't like that much Sargent's section on Pandas, but I didn't have time to prepare an intro to pandas.
 I recommend:
     - Check the cheatsheets I attach you for pandas.
     - Check the file macro_evidence_uganda.py: File that works with nationally representative household data
       from Uganda.
     - For any questions on pandas, feel free to ask me.
